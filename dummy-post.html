                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
                and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                the industry's standard dummy text ever since
                the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
                in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
                with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
                simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
                over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
                going through the cites of the word in classical
                literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
                (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
                the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
                line in section 1.10.32.
                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since
                the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus
                Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
                in their exact original form, accompanied by
                English versions from the 1914 translation by
                H. Rackham.
